   <description>
      Enables the Ebean enhancement to occur when you save in Eclipse
IDE.

You would typically use this plugin rather than configuring a
javaagent or using an ANT task (although you can use all three
together if you wish).

* Fast CODE - SAVE/COMPILE - RUN/TEST cycles during
development without having to configure a javaagent

* You enable/disable enhancement on a per-project basis 
(project - right mouse - Toggle Ebean Enhancement)

* you can adjust the debugging levels using preferences
(window - preferences - Ebean)
