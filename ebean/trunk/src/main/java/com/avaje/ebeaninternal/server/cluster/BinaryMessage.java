/**
 * Represents a relatively small independent message.
 * <p>
 * In general terms we break up a potentially large object like
 * RemoteTransactionEvent into many smaller BinaryMessages. This is so that if
 * they don't all fit on a single Packet we can easily break them up and put
 * them on multiple packets.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Also note that for the Multicast approach a Packet will generally contain
 * many messages each directed to different members of the cluster. So it would
 * be common for many Ack, Resend and Control messages to all be contained in a
 * single packet.
